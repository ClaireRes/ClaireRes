### Hey there, my name's Claire 👋

I'm an engineer (she/her) in Cambridge who found my way into the world of software by saying ✨ Hello 🌍 ✨ a few times!

I mainly work in Python 🐍 and JavaScript 💻 day to day on full stack web app development (Flask) and web automation (Selenium) for data analysis, with some use of C/C++ to spice things up!

I'm interested in all things machine learning and artificial intelligence-related (including the excellent early-noughties movie starring Jude Law 🤖...) and the ways we can apply these to help improve our everyday lives!

Want to chat about any of the above?
