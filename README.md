### Hello 🌍, my name's Claire (she/her) 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with 3 YoE working in London, with a background in Information & Bio Engineering!

I have experience working on customer-facing and internal tools for collaborative data analysis, and building frameworks for automation of test hardware for wireless connectivity.

My current day to day involves work as a BE Java dev ☕, but previously worked in Python 🐍 with some JavaScript 💻 for full stack web development, web automation and CLI-based projects, with the occasional bit of C/C++ thrown in!

#### 📙 Past Projects:
Interested in all things ML/AI related (including the excellent early-noughties movie starring Jude Law 🤖...)?

Interested in applications of tech to medical diagnosis? 🧑‍⚕️

Well then, why not check out [4YP](https://github.com/ClaireRes/4YP), my Masters project applying Deep Learning to predict respiratory disorders, such as asthma and COPD, from non-invasive imaging data!
